# FSSI
A Face Sketch Similarity Index for The Evaluation of The Styl-ized Videos
<br>
The existing image quality evaluation metrics suffer from lacking precision on as-sessing the stylized data. To alleviate this gap,  we have presented the FSSI technique to enhance the sensitivity of human perception on the quality of the stylized facial videos.

More details will come soonÔºÅ

Figure 2. FSSI (the blue line) and SSIM (the green line) results for different interference cases and the comparisons with SSIM. From left to right, the top row results are noise interference, fuzzy inter-ference and lack of interference, the bottom row results are distorted interference, mosaic inter-ference and Gaussian fuzzy interference.
